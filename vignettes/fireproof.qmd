```{r setup}

fireproof is a plugin for [fiery-based](http://fiery.data-imaginist.com) webservers (that includes [plumber2](http://plumber2.posit.co)), which adds an authorization and authentication framework to the server for you to take advantage of. The package supports a range of different auth schemes and allows you to specify the requirements of each endpoint very flexibly. However, before we dive into how it works, we'll give a brief overview of what we mean when we talk about authorization and authentication.
