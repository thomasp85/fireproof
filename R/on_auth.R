#' Predefined functions for handling successful OAuth 2.0 authentication
#'
#' When using the `"authorization code"` grant type in an OAuth 2.0
#' authorization flow, you have to decide what to do after an access token has
#' been successfully retrieved. Since the flow goes through multiple redirection
#' the original request is no longer available once the access token has been
#' retrieved. The `replay_request()` function will use the saved session_state
#' from the original request to construct a "fake" request and replay that on
#' the server to obtain the response it would have given had the user already
#' been authorized. The `redirect_back()` function will try to redirect the user
#' back to the location they where at when they send the request that prompted
#' authorization. You can also create your own function that e.g. presents a
#' "Successfully logged on" webpage. See *Details* for information on the
#' requirements for such a function.
#'
#' @details
#' Creating your own success handler is easy and just requires that you conform
#' to the input arguments of the functions described here. The main purpose of
#' the function is to modify the response object that is being send back to the
#' user to fit your needs. As with any routr handler it should return a boolean
#' indicating if further processing should happen. For this situation it is
#' usually sensible to return `FALSE`.
#'
#' @param request The current request being handled, as a [reqres::Request]
#' object. The result of a redirection from the authorization server.
#' @param response The response being returned to the user as a
#' [reqres::Response] object.
#' @param session_state A list of stored information from the original request.
#' Contains the following fields: `state` (a random string identifying the
#' authorization attempt), `time` (the timestamp of the original request),
#' `method` (the http method of the original request), `url` (the full url of
#' the original request, including any query string), `headers` (A named list of
#' all the headers of the original request), `body` (a raw vector of the body of
#' the original request), and `from` (The url the original request was sent
#' from)
#' @param server The fiery server handling the request
#'
#' @return `TRUE` if the request should continue processing in the server or
#' `FALSE` if the response should be send straight away
