fireproof is a plugin for [fiery](https://fiery.data-imaginist.com/) based servers. It provides a unified framework for adding authentication to your server backend. 

There is currently support for Basic and Bearer authentication as well as Key based authentication.

fireproof supports multiple authentication routes for each endpoint so that you can specify that access to a certain endpoint requires either passing this and/or this challenges. The logic can be arbitrarily complex though for your own sanity it probably shouldn't.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fireproof from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("thomasp85/fireproof")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(fireproof)

# Create the plugin
proof <- Fireproof$new()

# Create two different authenticators
key_auth <- auth_key(
  key = "FireproofKey",
  secret = "VerySecretString",
  cookie = FALSE
)
basic_auth <- auth_basic(
  authenticator = function(user, password, ...) {
    user == "thomas" && password == "1234"
  }
)

# Add them to the plugin
proof$add_auth(key_auth, "key")
proof$add_auth(basic_auth, "basic")

# Add authentication to some endpoints with varying combinations of requirements
proof$add_auth_handler("get", "/user/settings", basic) # must pass basic auth
proof$add_auth_handler("get", "/api/predict", key || basic) # must pass either
proof$add_auth_handler("get", "/strong/auth", key && basic) # must pass both

# If you have even more authenticators you can group conditions with () as well


# Create a fiery app with a firestore plugin and attach the plugin
app <- fiery::Fire$new()
fs <- firesale::FireSale$new(storr::driver_environment())
app$attach(fs)

app$attach(proof)
```

## OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
A lot of authorization on the internet has moved towards OAuth 2.0 and the authentication layer build on top of it (OpenID Connect). fireproof supports both of these and have basic constructors for both flows that take the required authorization or discovery endpoints and takes care of the rest. It also comes with a selection of predefined constructors for well-known providers such as Google and GitHub that makes it easy to use them. If you want to use another provider than one already available I'll invite you create a PR for it based on how the current providers have been implemented. In this way we can gradually grow the number of providers offered out of the box based on what the community needs.

### Current OAuth/OpenID Connect support

* Google✽
* GitHub
* Beeceptor (Used for mocking)
